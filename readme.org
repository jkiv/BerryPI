* Limitation
The present version is restricted to cases when the lattice vectors correspond to cartesian directions. For example, the zinc-blend or NaCl structures should be regarded as an 8 atom cell instead of the conventional 2 atom basis.

* To Do
- Non-orthogonal lattice vectors: Extendting the capability of "BerryPI" to computing of polrization for structures with non-orthogonal lattice vectors
- Band by band decomposition: Provide analysis of contribution from individual electronic bands (or their range) to the electronic polarization. The present version enables calculation of the Berry phase for a given band range (-b switch), but more testing need to be performed.
